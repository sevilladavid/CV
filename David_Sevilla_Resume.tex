\section*{Other Projects}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
{\bf Image Cryptography} & Developed a GUI cryptography application in MATLAB. This application is able to conceal a text message or an image within a color image. This application can reveal the hidden data if a secret security key is provided.\vspace{1 ex} \\ 

{\bf Smart door lock } & Lead and develop a device that allows a home owner to know who is at the door, communicate with the visitor and unlock the door remotely using a wearable device.  This was implemented in Arduino using Wi-Fi and FM communications. The system was actuated using an electromechanical lock.\vspace{1 ex}\\

\bf{Robot Simulator} & Developed robotic arm simulator that allows offline programming and 3D visualization of the manipulator using MATLAB. The output of this application is the manipulator motion program that can be uploaded to and industrial robotic arm. This application was tested on a KUKA 5 ARC. \vspace{1 ex}\\

{\bf Race Car Simulator} & Developed a replica of a race-car cockpit, with three degrees of freedom that simulates car acceleration (Such as those of flight training simulators). The cockpit was wired to a remote control car that contained a camera and an accelerometer and allowed the driver to feel the sensation of being inside the car.  \vspace{1 ex}\\

{\bf Twitter Weather Report} & Lead and developed a fuzzy logic application that analyzed real time weather data from a weather station. This application updated a Twitter weather feed with natural language. \\
